# CondoChase: AI Powered Condo Price Estimator

CondoChase is a full-stack web application designed for university students to navigate the complex real estate market. 
Using a trained neural network, the platform provides accurate price estimations to ensure students aren't overpaying 
for housing because when you're a student, every dollar counts.

# The Mission

Finding housing near campus is stressful and expensive. I built this because "the wrong price" isn't just a number,
it’s money taken away from tuition, textbooks, and groceries. 
CondoChase empowers students with data-backed insights to negotiate better and rent smarter.
